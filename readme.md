 <b>Lifetech OCMS</b> is a modern PHP backend framework designed for building secure, scalable, and modular applications. It incorporates innovative features that differentiate it from traditional PHP frameworks. Here's an overview:
Key Features:

    **Model-View-Controller **(MVC)** Architecture:**
        Promotes a clear separation of concerns for efficient development.

    **Data Defacing Model (DDM):**
        Encrypts all developer code formats (PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) during deployment.
        Decrypts securely in memory during runtime to ensure robust security and prevent reverse engineering.

   **Software UNIQUE KEY:**
        Lifetech generate an unique key for your application so that no one can copy or rename your files with the activation of that key.
        The Unique key is free and can be regenerated. This give the developers confidence to release their software to shared domain or local servers

   ** Separation of Modules, Themes, and Plugins:**
        Enables fast development and easy customization.
        Modules encapsulate features, themes define UI, and plugins extend functionality.

   ** LW-Token System**:
        Implements a secure token exchange mechanism between frontend and backend.
        Supports both stateless (JWT) and stateful (database-backed) tokens with dynamic expiration.

   ** Jlon (JavaScript Lifetech Object Notation):**
        A proprietary data model optimized for efficient communication between frontend and backend.

   ** Frontend Compatibility:**
        Compatible with popular frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

    **Security Focus:**
        Offers advanced protections, including token-based authentication and runtime code decryption.

   ** No Migrations for Models:**
        Models are created directly from the database tables without a migration step.

    **Unique Query Builder (Maplite):**
        Facilitates database operations like retrieval and deletion.

    **Custom Templating Engine (Liferazor):**
        Uses special syntax for rendering PHP variables and language blocks.

    **Custom Response Handling:**
        Provides a response() function with a structured json() method for clear API responses.

## Notable Origins and Dedication:

    Lifetech OCMS was created in the Computer Science Department of Ogun State Institute of Technology (OGITECH), Igbesa.
    It is dedicated to a lecturer at OGITECH, the late Mr. Aluko Temitope.
    The framework was innovated by Mr. Ajayi Abolore Abdulgafaru.
    
## Security Vulnerabilities
